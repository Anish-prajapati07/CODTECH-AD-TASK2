# Overview of the project
•	The Python script provided implements a basic web vulnerability scanner that checks for common issues like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in both URLs and forms. It uses the requests library for HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content
# Features:
1.	SQL Injection Testing: Injects common SQL payloads to identify vulnerabilities in query parameters.

2.	XSS Testing: Checks for XSS vulnerabilities in both URL parameters and HTML forms.

3.	Form Analysis: Extracts and tests forms for vulnerabilities using injected payloads.

# How to Use:
1.	Run the script and provide a target URL when prompted.

2.	The scanner will:

  •	Test the URL for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

  •	Extract and test all forms for XSS.

# Limitations:
1.	It assumes a simplistic attack surface and payloads.

2.	Does not handle complex multi-step forms or modern CSRF tokens.

3.	Requires the user to provide a base URL with a query parameter
